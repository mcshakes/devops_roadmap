# DevOps Exercises: A Hands-On Journey

Welcome to my DevOps Exercises repository. The goal here is to learn and solidify my understanding of core DevOps practices by tackling bite-sized (sometimes) projects and challenges. Each folder in this repo focuses on a different aspect of DevOps—from setting up CI/CD pipelines to managing infrastructure as code—following the roadmap from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects?g=devops). 

## Tech Stack & Approach
In these exercises, I use a range of tools and frameworks commonly found in modern DevOps environments. My approach involves breaking down each project into manageable parts, documenting my thought processes, and reflecting on the challenges faced. 

_Technologies Used_:
- Terraform
- Bash

### Project Modules:

Each module below contains a `journal.md` file with the assignment details and requirements; steps to configure and implement; and general thoughts on getting the work done.
